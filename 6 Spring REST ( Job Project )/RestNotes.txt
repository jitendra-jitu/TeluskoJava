==> TRANSFER OF STATE ( CURRENT CONDITION RESOURCE )

1 REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

2 REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
