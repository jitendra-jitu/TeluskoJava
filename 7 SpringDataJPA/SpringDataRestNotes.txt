HATEOAS in Spring Boot(Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 HATEOAS is the concept within REST that enables the client to interact with the RESTful service entirely through hyperlinks provided dynamically by the service itself.

2 It means the client does not need to hardcode the URIs of the resource but can discover them at runtime.

3 In Spring Boot, HATEOAS can be implemented using the spring-boot-starter-hateoas dependency which allows the easy creation of hypermedia links and resources.

4 With HATEOAS each resource representation returned by the server can contain the links to related resources or actions that the client can follow.
